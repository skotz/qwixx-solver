## How to Use

Basically the numbers under the numbers on the Qwixx scorecard are the probabilities that a given move is the best move in the position based on tons of random playouts. The number that is highlighted red is the very best play according to the solver.

You can give the dice at the top values that are in your game, and it will show you the best plays that you could make.
